 Born and raised in the DMV, my passion for music led me to start DJing at local venues a few years ago.
  Since then, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of performing at some of the city's top bars and clubs, the Kennedy Center, as well as numerous private events and weddings.
  Dedicated to spreading love and positivity through sound and making each
  event as unforgettable and fun as possible.
